Regarding the sweets selling on the website, we have decided not to create a separate website or complex setup. Instead, we will add one new page within Noon's website.

The new page will be called “Butter and Butter Shop.”
This page will follow a normal WooCommerce shop style, but with different branding that matches Butter and Butter’s identity.

The shop page will be divided into two sub-sections:
- Sweets
- Raw Materials

All items will be added as normal products.
On the shop page, each product should display:
- Product name
- Price

When a user opens a specific product, they should be able to see:
- Product name
- Product description
- Multiple photos
